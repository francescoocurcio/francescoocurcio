### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Francesco from Italy, I'm a Computer Engineering graduate and currently an Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning fellow student at University of Calabria (IT).
My academic path is characterised by big data, analysis and learning models and I'm always happy to learn something new about them!
